# LeadCaptureWebSite
A marketing website used to capture leads for Medicare sales

The website provides a level of personal marketing for an individual agent/agency.
The "Contact" page allows for potential customers to enter their personal information,
inviting the agent to reach out and schedule a sales appointment.  This data is 
captured in a backend database for inclusion in a larger customer database.
